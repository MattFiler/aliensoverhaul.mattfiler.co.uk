                    <p>Experience Aliens: Colonial Marines how it should have been when it first released. This heavily balanced and thoroughly play-tested mod is built for exciting, suspenseful and most importantly, fun gameplay.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Xenomorphs have seen the most improvements, with fixes to their behavior and core mechanics to make them truly terrifying foes, dramatically shifting the tone of the entire campaign.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This state of the bad-ass art modification for Aliens: Colonial Marines reworks, reprograms and rebalances xenomorph AI, human AI, weapon mechanics, ballistics, animations, shaders, particles, decals, lighting, and engine features to get the best out of the game possible. This is truly the ultimate Aliens gaming experience!</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Engine / System</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Compatibility File modified so that all graphics card, regardless of model get by default the maximum quality settings available.</li>
                          <li>Shadow Management modified to allow higher resolution shadows, and more low resolution distant shadows to ensure no pop-in of lighting mechanics.</li>
                          <li>Texture input switched to use maximum LOD values, Anistropic Filtering and higher quality Sharpening filter for distant textures</li>
                          <li>Particle System Spawn Rates, Life Times and LOD settings increased to remove resource limit restrictions Many Particle Effects redesigned using different effects to increase visibility / quality of the over-all in-game effects (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Lighting Models for Objects and Statics and many world objects improved through changes to Specular, Diffuse, Rim Lighting and Normal Mapping adjustments (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Dead Bodies, Body Parts, Acid Splashes and Blood Splashes remain in the game world indefinitely (to the limit of the engine, plus some points "clear" the level where everything is removed)</li>
                          <li>Spawning Volumes for dynamic and wave-attack sequences in the campaign have had a significant increase to the number of Xeno's and Mercs that can be spawned. (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Xeno's can easily overwhelm an area if not dealt with immediately, and Mercenary Loadouts are much more varied, with more smart-gun/flamer/battle-file merc's spawning.</li>
                          <li>Tracer fire on all weapons switched to use the Sentry Gun tracer. This is what it looked like in the E3 demo</li>
                          <li>Dropped weapons stay around for a really long time</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Campaign (Entire feature set is WIP)</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>One-Off and special objects, effects and sequences have been beefed up and made to look as good as they can</li>
                          <li>Fog, Smoke, Rain and other scene effects increased in density for particular areas to enhance the atmosphere</li>
                          <li>Timings of cinematics tweaked where possible</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Xenomorph Shared</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Animations for Melee Combat (Win / Tie / Lose), Stance Changes, Jumping, Surface Transition, Stalking and Idling re-timed for better in-game behavior and movement (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Damage Zones and Critical Hit amounts reworked so that Head Shots are needed to take a Xeno down quickly, with glancing shots doing little damage</li>
                          <li>Weapon Fire impacts and Deaths cause visual acid spurts/splashes that will burn and damage anything it touches</li>
                          <li>Xenomorph Soldier / Crusher (most actions for the Crusher are heavily scripted, but any dynamic actions use Soldier AI mechanics)</li>
                          <li>Movement Speed, Acceleration, Weight, Jump Power and Flight Speed rebalanced so they are extremely agile and move swiftly around the cluttered levels.</li>
                          <li>Melee Encounter Mechanics modified so that they are almost exclusively used when it will kill the target. Xenos will wear down your armor with claws and kill you with an encounter</li>
                          <li>Pouncing reworked to improve movement around the map by reducing the maximum distance to consider jumping to. This leads to better object hurdling and wall/roof usage</li>
                          <li>Limitations of switching between wall/roof/floor "opened" to allow more dynamic approaches</li>
                          <li>Combat Damage significantly increased so only a few claw attacks are required to down a human (WIP)</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Xenomorph Lurker</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>AI decision timing increased 500% to increase their ability to outmaneuver you, without being impossibly difficult. Lurkers are truly terrifying!</li>
                          <li>Movement Speed, Acceleration, Weight, Jump Power and Flight Speed rebalanced so they are extremely agile and move swiftly around the cluttered levels.</li>
                          <li>Cover Mechanics reworked so they are exposed even less and move more often to stay hidden</li>
                          <li>Combat Mechanics reworked so that they will wear you down through several spaced attacks before finishing you with a Melee Encounter</li>
                          <li>Pouncing significantly nerfed to force them to run around instead of jumping across the maps. Increases their vulnerability crossing open spaces</li>
                          <li>Melee encounter difficulty increased so fighting it off is a challenge (WIP)</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Xenomorph Ranger</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>AI decision timing increased 500% so that they are much more reactive in their position choices. Rangers will quickly reposition to continue their barrage</li>
                          <li>Movement Speed, Acceleration, Weight, Jump Power and Flight Speed rebalanced so they are extremely agile and move swiftly around the cluttered levels.</li>
                          <li>Melee combat reconfigured to match Soldier melee combat. This makes Rangers more deadly than Soldiers!</li>
                          <li>Acid does alot more damage but flies slower through the air to compensate (WIP)</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Xenomorph Boiler</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>No changes have been directly made to the Boiler. Its AI is based on the Xeno Soldier, however its specialized mechanics already set a great pace in their short sewer sequence in the campaign so I did not change them.</li>
                          <li>Their explosion however uses the generic acid damage mechanics and so are much more dangerous to groups</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Xenomorph Facehugger</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>AI decision timing increased 200% to increase their ability quickly find a good pouncing position and hide from gunfire</li>
                          <li>Movement Speed and Acceleration rebalanced so they are extremely quick and hard to hit</li>
                          <li>Health greatly increased so a single hit won't stop them (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Melee encounter difficulty greatly increased so fighting them off is super hard (WIP)</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Human Shared</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Animations for Stance Changes, Awareness and Idling reworked to look smoother (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Situational Voice Acting reworked to make AI more chatty and informative. Calling out enemies, movements and kills more often, as well as making scenic comments (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Awareness reconfigured to be much more realistic opening up more tactical game-play options</li>
                          <li>Vision reworked to allow sneaking and hiding to be used allowing stealth play in some sequences. AI reposition more often to get a better line of sight on their target</li>
                          <li>Gore Mechanics enabled for human corpses, allowing incidental damage and reactions to explosions after death</li>
                          <li>Weapons Carried by AI use the same Recoil and Ballistics of the player weapons, and as such effect how deadly they are with each weapon (see below)</li>
                          <li>Armor used by the AI use the same mechanics as the Player armor (see below)</li>
                      </ul>
                    <li>Weyland Yutani Mercaneries</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Teamwork tactics and information sharing reconfigured to remove their hive-mind like abilities. They share only what you hear them say</li>
                          <li>Weapon Damage rebalanced to reduce their threat level against humans and xenos. Greatly reduces the frustration of fighting them, and makes them much weaker vs Xenos (WIP)</li>
                          <li>Health GREATLY reduced (they had 4x the health of the player originally)</li>
                      </ul>

                          <li>Texture input switched to use maximum LOD values, Anistropic Filtering and higher quality Sharpening filter for distant textures</li>
                          <li>Particle System Spawn Rates, Life Times and LOD settings increased to remove resource limit restrictions
Many Particle Effects redesigned using different effects to increase visibility / quality of the over-all in-game effects</li>
                          <li>Lighting Models for Objects and Statics and many world objects improved through changes to Specular, Diffuse, Rim Lighting and Normal Mapping adjustments</li>
                          <li>Dead Bodies, Body Parts, Acid Splashes and Blood Splashes remain in the game world indefinitely</li>
                          <li>Spawning Volumes for dynamic and wave-attack sequences in the campaign have had a significant increase to the number of Xeno's and Mercs that can be spawned.</li>
                          <li>Xeno's can easily overwhelm an area if not dealt with immediately, and Mercenary Loadouts are much more varied, with more smart-gun/flamer/battle-file merc's spawning.</li>
                          <li>Tracer fire on all weapons switched to use the Sentry Gun tracer. This is an orange visible "bolt" and looks fantastic, really helping with gun on gun combat</li>

                          <li>Damage Zones and Critical Hit amounts reworked so that Head Shots are needed to take a Xeno down quickly, with glancing shots doing little damage</li>

                          <li>AI decision timing increased 1000% to greatly increase their ability to adapt to changing situations and react to new threats</li>

                          <li>Melee Encounter Mechanics modified so that they are almost exclusively used when it will kill the target. Xenos will wear down your armor with claws and kill you with an encounter</li>
                          <li>Pouncing reworked to improve movement around the map by reducing the maximum distance to consider jumping to. This leads to better object hurdling and wall/roof usage</li>

                          <li>AI decision timing increased 500% to increase their ability to outmaneuver you, without being impossibly difficult. Lurkers are truly terrifying!</li>
                          <li>Movement Speed, Acceleration, Weight, Jump Power and Flight Speed rebalanced so they are extremely agile and move swiftly around the cluttered levels.</li>
                          <li>Cover Mechanics reworked so they are exposed even less and move more often to stay hidden</li>
                          <li>Combat Mechanics reworked so that they will wear you down through several spaced attacks before finishing you with a Melee Encounter</li>

                          <li>AI decision timing increased 500% so that they are much more reactive in their position choices. Rangers will quickly reposition to continue their barrage</li>
                          <li>Movement Speed, Acceleration, Weight, Jump Power and Flight Speed rebalanced so they are extremely agile and move swiftly around the cluttered levels.</li>
                          <li>Melee combat reconfigured to match Soldier melee combat. This makes Rangers more deadly than Soldiers!</li>

                      <ul>
                          <li>No changes have been directly made to the Boiler. Its AI is based on the Xeno Soldier, however its specialized mechanics already set a great pace in their short sewer sequence in the campaign so I did not change them.</li>
                          <li>Their explosion however uses the generic acid damage mechanics and so are much more dangerous to groups</li>

                          <li>Vision reworked to allow sneaking and hiding to be used allowing stealth play in some sequences. AI reposition more often to get a better line of sight on their target</li>
                          <li>Gore Mechanics enabled for human corpses, allowing incidental damage and reactions to explosions after death</li>
                          <li>Weapons Carried by AI use the same Recoil and Ballistics of the player weapons, and as such effect how deadly they are with each weapon (see below)</li>
                          <li>Armor used by the AI use the same mechanics as the Player armor (see below)</li>

                          <li>Weapon Damage rebalanced to reduce their threat level against humans and xenos. Greatly reduces the frustration of fighting them, and makes them much weaker vs Xenos</li>
                          <li>Health GREATLY reduced (they had 4x the health of the player originally)</li>

                          <li>Weapon Damage rebalanced to increase their effectiveness in combat dramatically without making them overpowered.</li>
